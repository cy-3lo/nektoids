# Decisions

Append-only. One entry per decision that constrains future work. A later entry may supersede an
earlier one; say so explicitly.

Format: **ID — date — decision.** Why. Consequence.

**D-001 — 2026-09-29 — Toolchain: pygame-ce + pygbag, published on itch.io as HTML5.**
Python for both contributors; browser delivery without a rewrite.
WASM CPython has no JIT, so physics is numpy-vectorised, and the main loop is async.

**D-002 — 2026-09-29 — Everything pygbag bundles lives under `game/`; tests and docs stay outside.**
pygbag packages the whole app folder; tests, docs and CI config have no business in the web build.
pytest finds the code through `pythonpath = ["game"]`.

**D-003 — 2026-09-29 — Weekend scope lock as written in `CLAUDE.md`.**
Ship three tutorial levels and one real level in two days.
Out-of-scope ideas are logged here as "post-jam", not implemented.

**D-004 — 2026-09-29 — Determinism is guaranteed per platform, not across native and WASM.**
numpy SIMD paths and libm functions can differ in the last ulp; the dynamics amplify it.
Win conditions are robust counts with margin, never an exact trajectory.

**D-005 — 2026-09-29 — Ownership: the physicist owns `sim/`, the CS student owns `graph/` and `editor/`.**
Each works where he learns most from the other's review.
Every PR is reviewed by the non-owner.

**D-006 — 2026-09-29 — Names: the studio is Cy-3LO, the game is Nektoids.**
Nekton (organisms that swim rather than drift) + the -oids of boids and asteroids; the studio is
C. Eloy in leetspeak. Both came back clear on GitHub, Steam, the App Store and the domain
registries; itch.io search, Google and TMview (classes 9 and 41) to be checked by hand.
Canonical spellings: "Cy-3LO" and "Nektoids"; `cy-3lo` and `nektoids` in handles and URLs.
The studio logo must not reference C-3PO visually.

**D-007 — 2026-09-29 — Editor: small hex board, auto-routed wires, straight crossings only.**
Pointy-top hexes; the level sets the board size and either pre-places the sensors and thrusters
(locked, tutorial and first levels) or hands them out as palette stock. A wire joins two components
by the shortest free path, then the fewest bends, then the fixed direction order E, NE, NW, W, SW,
SE. A cell holds one component, or one wire that bends there, or up to three straight wires on
distinct axes. Dropping a component on a cell a wire uses is refused.
Every crossing reads unambiguously on screen (invariant 6), and layout stays part of the puzzle.
Routes depend on build order and never move once drawn, so the board on screen is the layout. If
crossings are to be expensive (brief §1), the cost goes into `complexity()`.

**D-008 — 2026-09-29 — Sensors and thrusters are oriented; rotating them is post-jam.**
Orientation is physical: where an eye looks, which way a thruster pushes. The editor draws it in
the agent's frame with forward = E (the sim's +x): half-disc eyes, square thrusters with a nose.
For the jam it is fixed per kind (left eye NE, right eye SE, thrusters E) and there is no rotate
tool, because choosing it is sensor layout editing, which the scope lock excludes.
Post-jam: a rotate tool in 60° steps, and one bundled icon font (open licence, small, loaded at
startup, checked under pygbag) to mark sensor and actuator types (light, flow, ...) inside the shapes.

**D-009 — 2026-09-30 — Supersedes D-008's rotation clause: the player turns eyes and thrusters.**
Where an eye looks and which way a thruster pushes are part of the mechanism the player authors.
A Rotate tool in the toolbar turns a placed eye or thruster by 60° (click: clockwise, shift-click:
back). New parts take their kind's default direction. Converters have no direction; locked parts
placed by a level keep theirs. The scope lock in `CLAUDE.md` now has sensor directions in and
moving sensors on the body out.
The sim reads each eye's and thruster's direction from the board, never from a constant.
